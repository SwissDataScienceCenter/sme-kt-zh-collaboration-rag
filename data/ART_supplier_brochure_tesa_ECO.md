**Disclaimer:** The 68% CO₂ reduction figure is based on an internal comparative assessment conducted by tesa SE and has not been independently verified through a third-party lifecycle assessment (LCA) or Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). Carbon neutrality is a forward-looking target, not a current verified status. The ecoLogo certification applies to packaging efficiency criteria and does not certify the overall carbon footprint of the product.
