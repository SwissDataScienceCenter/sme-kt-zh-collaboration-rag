# Relicyc — Logypal 1 Product Data Sheet

*Version: 1.0 | Date: June 2021 | Issued by: Relicyc SAS*

> **⚠ SUPERSEDED DOCUMENT**
> This document has been superseded by the third-party verified Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for Logypal 1, published in 2023 (Relicyc EPD No. S-P-10482). The EPD is the authoritative source for all environmental claims. This document is retained for historical reference only. Where figures conflict, the EPD takes precedence.

## Product: Logypal 1 — Recycled Plastic Pallet

### Overview

The Logypal 1 is Relicyc's flagship pallet, manufactured from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic — primarily sourced from end-of-life agricultural packaging (silage film) and industrial packaging waste. It is designed as a direct drop-in replacement for standard EUR wood pallets (1200 × 800 mm).

### Internal LCA Results (2020, non-verified)

The following results are from an internal lifecycle assessment conducted by Relicyc in 2020 using the SimaPro software and the ecoinvent 3.6 database. The study followed ISO 14044 methodology. Functional unit: **1 pallet over a 50-trip expected lifetime**.

| Environmental Impact | Logypal 1 | Conventional Wood Pallet | Virgin Plastic Pallet |
|----------------------|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **GWP (kg CO₂e/pallet)** | **4.1** | 5.8 | 8.9 |
| Primary energy use (MJ) | 68 | 72 | 130 |
| Water use (litres) | 42 | 180 | 38 |
| Eutrophication (g PO₄e) | 12 | 18 | 9 |
| Waste generated (kg) | 0.8 | 1.4 | 0.6 |

*These figures were not independently verified at time of publication. Allocation method: mass allocation. End-of-life: closed-loop recycling assumed.*

### Material Composition (2021)

- Body: 100% post-consumer recycled HDPE (claimed, not independently audited)
- No virgin plastic content (claimed)
- Pigments: carbon black masterbatch
- Metal: none

### Certifications (2021)

None held at time of publication. EPD in planning.

## Update Notice (added retrospectively, February 2024)

A third-party verified Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Logypal 1 was published in 2023. The EPD was conducted by an accredited LCA practitioner and verified by an independent third-party verifier in accordance with ISO 14025 and EN 15804.

**The EPD figures differ from the 2020 internal LCA results** due to:
1. Updated ecoinvent database version
2. Updated supplier-specific energy data for the Relicyc production facility
3. Revised end-of-life modelling (open-loop recycling, not closed-loop)
4. Changed allocation approach from mass to economic allocation for recycled input

Users who cited the 4.1 kg CO₂e/pallet figure from this 2021 datasheet should update their references to use the verified EPD figures.
