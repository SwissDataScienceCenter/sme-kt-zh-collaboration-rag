# CPR System — Wooden Pallet 1208 Sustainability Fact Sheet

*Issued by: CPR System SRL | March 2023*
*Product ID (PrimePack AG): 32-101*

---

## Sustainable by Nature

The CPR System Wooden Pallet 1208 is crafted from sustainably sourced European softwood. Wood is nature's original circular material — it sequesters carbon as it grows, stores it throughout the product's lifetime, and returns to the cycle at end of life.

## Climate Impact

| Metric | Value | Scope |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Global Warming Potential — production phase | **2.1 kg CO₂e per pallet** | Cradle-to-gate |
| Global Warming Potential — full lifecycle | **–1.8 kg CO₂e per pallet** | Cradle-to-grave |
| Carbon storage in wood (biogenic) | –5.6 kg CO₂e per pallet | During use phase |
| End-of-life (wood chip recycling) | +1.7 kg CO₂e per pallet | Disposal credit |

**Our wooden pallets are carbon-negative over their full service life.** The carbon stored in the timber during forest growth more than offsets the emissions from production, transport, and end-of-life processing.

*Methodology: Internal LCA by CPR System, based on ISO 14044. Functional unit: 1 pallet, 10-trip expected lifetime. Emission factors from ecoinvent 3.8 database. Results have not been independently verified.*

## Important Note on Data Verification

The environmental figures in this fact sheet are based on an **internal lifecycle assessment conducted by CPR System** using industry-standard methodology (ISO 14044). This assessment has **not been reviewed or verified by an independent third party**. No Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) has been issued for the Wooden Pallet 1208. CPR System plans to commission an independent EPD for this product line by end of 2025.

Until an EPD is available, these figures should be treated as indicative estimates, not verified environmental performance data.
