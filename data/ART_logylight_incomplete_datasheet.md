# Relicyc LogyLight — Sustainability Information Sheet

*Supplier: Relicyc SAS | Issued: November 2024*
*Product ID (PrimePack AG): 32-104*

---

## Product Overview

The LogyLight is Relicyc's newest pallet model, optimised for reduced weight without sacrificing load capacity. It targets logistics operations where payload weight is a constraint. The pallet body is produced from post-consumer recycled HDPE collected from industrial packaging waste streams (primarily silage film and industrial wrapping).

Target markets: food distribution, retail, pharmaceutical logistics.

## Material Composition

| Component | Material | Recycled Content | Verification |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Pallet body | HDPE | **75% post-consumer recycled** | Self-declared by Relicyc — not independently verified |
| Reinforcement inserts | Virgin HDPE | 0% recycled | — |
| Colour pigment | Carbon black masterbatch | Not specified | — |
| Metal inserts (corners) | None | — | — |

**Note:** The 75% recycled content figure is a self-declaration by Relicyc based on their internal mass balance. No third-party audit of this claim has been performed.

**LCA Status:** Relicyc has commissioned a full lifecycle assessment (ISO 14044 compliant) for the LogyLight. The study is being conducted by an accredited LCA practitioner. A third-party verified Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) is expected to be published by **Q2 2025**.

Until the EPD is available, **no verified environmental impact data can be provided for this product.** Do not use this product's environmental profile in customer-facing communications.

## Regulatory Compliance

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| REACH (no SVHC above 0.1% w/w) | Confirmed ✓ |
| RoHS | Not applicable (industrial product) |
| PFAS declaration | Not yet provided to PrimePack AG |
| ISPM 15 | Not applicable (plastic pallet) |

## Comparison with Logypal 1 (32-103)

The Logypal 1 is Relicyc's established pallet model with a full third-party verified EPD (issued 2023). Key differences:

| | Logypal 1 (32-103) | LogyLight (32-104) |
|--|---------------------|---------------------|
| Weight | Standard | 28% lighter |
| Recycled content (claimed) | 100% PCR | 75% PCR |
| EPD available | **Yes** | **No** |
| GWP (verified) | See EPD document | Not available |

**Consequence for purchasing decisions:** A fair environmental comparison between the Logypal 1 and the LogyLight cannot currently be made, because the LogyLight has no verified environmental data. The only basis for comparison would be the Relicyc EPD for Logypal 1 versus unverified self-declarations for LogyLight.
