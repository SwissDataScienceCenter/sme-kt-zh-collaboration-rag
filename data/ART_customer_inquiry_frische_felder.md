**Subject:** Request for Sustainability Documentation — Tape and Cardboard Products

Dear PrimePack AG Team,

Thank you for our ongoing partnership. As part of our updated supplier due diligence process in line with the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), we require the following information for the packaging products we source from you:

**Tape Products (Product IDs: 50-100, 50-101, 50-102)**

1a. Are any of your tape products free of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)? Please provide a PFAS declaration or equivalent confirmation for each product.

1b. Can you provide verified carbon footprint data (EPD or equivalent) for each tape product?

1c. For tesapack ECO & ULTRA STRONG (50-102): The tesa website states this product is on a path to "carbon neutrality." Is this claim independently verified? If so, please provide the verification certificate.

**Cardboard Packaging (Product ID: 11-101)**

2a. Is the Grupak corrugated cardboard packaging FSC certified? If yes, please provide the FSC certificate number so we can verify it at info.fsc.org.

2b. What is the verified Global Warming Potential (GWP) for Product 11-101?

**General**

3a. Which of your products are covered by a third-party verified Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)?

We would appreciate a response by **31 January 2025**. Incomplete responses are acceptable, please clearly indicate where information is not yet available.

Kind regards,

Dear Ms. Keller,

Thank you for your inquiry and for the detailed context. We appreciate your diligence. Please find our responses below.

### Response to Section 1: Tape Products

**1a. PFAS declarations:**

We have reviewed the available technical documentation for our tape products. Unfortunately, we do not yet hold PFAS declarations from our tape suppliers.

- Product 50-100 (IPG Hot Melt Tape): The available Technical Data Sheet does not explicitly address PFAS content. **[ACTION: Request PFAS declaration from IPG, not yet received]**
- Product 50-101 (IPG Water-Activated Tape): Same situation. **[ACTION: Request PFAS declaration from IPG, not yet received]**
- Product 50-102 (Tesa tesapack ECO): The tesa product information states the adhesive is "free of intentionally added solvents." PFAS status is not explicitly addressed. **[ACTION: Contact tesa for explicit PFAS declaration, not yet received]**

We have initiated formal PFAS declaration requests with all tape suppliers. We will forward declarations as they are received. We regret we cannot confirm PFAS-free status at this time.

**1b. Carbon footprint data for tape products:**

- Product 50-100 (IPG Hot Melt Tape): **EPD available.** Third-party verified EPD on file. We will attach this document to our response.
- Product 50-101 (IPG Water-Activated Tape): **EPD available.** Third-party verified EPD on file. We will attach this document to our response.
- Product 50-102 (Tesa tesapack ECO): **No EPD available.** Tesa's sustainability brochure references a 68% CO₂ reduction versus their 2019 baseline conventional product, but this is based on an internal comparative assessment and has not been independently verified through an ISO 14044 lifecycle assessment. We cannot provide an EPD for this product at this time.

**1c. Carbon neutrality claim for tesapack ECO (50-102):**

The carbon neutrality claim refers to a 2025 target stated by Tesa SE, not a current verified status. No independent verification certificate exists for this claim. This claim should not be cited as a verified environmental fact.

### Response to Section 2: Cardboard Packaging

**2a. FSC certification for Grupak (11-101):**

The Grupak EPD references FSC certification. **[ACTION: Locate FSC certificate number from Grupak documentation and insert here before sending. Verify at info.fsc.org.]**

**2b. GWP for Product 11-101:**

**[ACTION: Extract verified GWP figure from the Grupak EPD and insert here before sending.]**

### Response to Section 3: General

**3a. Products with third-party verified EPDs:**

The following products are covered by a third-party verified EPD:
- 50-100 (IPG Hot Melt Tape)
- 50-101 (IPG Water-Activated Tape)
- 32-100 (CPR Noé Pallet)
- 32-103 (Relicyc Logypal 1)
- 32-105 (StabilPlastik EP 08)
- 11-100 (Redbox Cartonpallet CMP)
- 11-101 (Grupak Corrugated Cardboard)

Products without a verified EPD: 50-102, 32-101, 32-102, 32-104.

**3b. Sustainability procurement policy:**

**[ACTION: Attach finalised version of internal procurement policy once approved by management. Current version (v1.2) is under final review.]**
