# Product Portfolio Policy & Supplier Catalog

*Internal reference document | Last updated: January 2025*

> **Note on document format:** In a real company this document would typically be a Word file or PDF stored in SharePoint. Markdown is used here for readability during the workshop. The machine-readable product list (with IDs, suppliers, and EPD status) lives in `product_overview.xlsx`.

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **policy** for how PrimePack AG manages and communicates sustainability information for its packaging portfolio. It covers:

- Which evidence levels are acceptable for customer-facing claims
- Which products are and are not in our active portfolio
- Open compliance action items by supplier

For the full product list with EPD availability and evidence levels, see **`product_overview.xlsx`**.

## Evidence Level Definitions

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **A — Verified** | Third-party verified EPD (ISO 14044 / ISO 14025) or equivalent certification |
| **B — Supported** | Self-declared claim with supporting calculation and disclosed methodology |
| **C — Claimed** | Supplier assertion; no methodology or evidence provided |
| **D — Missing** | No sustainability data available |

Only Level A evidence may be shared with customers as fact. Levels B and C must be accompanied by a caveat. Level D must be flagged as a gap.

## Portfolio Scope

PrimePack AG currently offers three product categories: **pallets**, **cardboard boxes**, and **tape**. All active products and their suppliers are listed in `product_overview.xlsx`.

### Products NOT in Our Portfolio

The following product types are **not** currently offered by PrimePack AG:

- Any product from a supplier not listed in `product_overview.xlsx`
- Products named "Lara Pallet", "EuroPack", "GreenLog", or similar — these are not in our portfolio
- Single-use bubble wrap or foam packaging
- Biodegradable tape products
- Compostable packaging of any kind

If a customer asks about a product not in the catalog, the correct answer is: *"We do not carry this product. Please refer to our current product catalog."*

---

## Customer Communication Rules

- **Level A evidence:** May be cited directly as verified fact, with source document named.
- **Level B/C evidence:** Must be presented as a supplier claim, not a verified fact. Example: *"The supplier states X, but this has not been independently verified."*
- **Level D (missing data):** Must be flagged explicitly. Do not estimate or extrapolate.
- **Conflicting sources:** If two documents give different figures for the same product, flag the conflict, state both values, and prefer the more recent third-party verified source.
- **PFAS declarations:** Currently outstanding for all tape suppliers (see action items). Do not make PFAS-free claims until declarations are received.
